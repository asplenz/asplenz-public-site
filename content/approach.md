# Approach

## From reconstruction to factual continuity

### The failure mode

When an incident, transaction, or decision is examined, teams often rely on:

- Distributed logs across systems
- Dashboards reflecting current state
- Tickets and post-mortems written later
- Human memory

This creates a predictable failure mode:

- Timelines are reconstructed
- Interpretations replace facts
- Explanations remain contestable

---

### The shift

The question shifts from:

"How does the system usually behave?"

to:

**"What exactly happened in this specific case?"**

At that point, the cost is not only time.
It is the **loss of institutional control over the narrative**.

---

### Principle

**Evidence must be produced at the point of no return: the moment an action becomes irreversible or responsibility is engaged.**

---

### What "fact" means here

In this context, a fact is:

> *a signed and recorded act or declaration, produced by a system or a human actor, regardless of its business truth or regulatory correctness.*

This capability does not certify reality. It preserves what was declared and executed, **immutably and in order**.
