# Market Infrastructures

## Market Infrastructures require institutional evidence

### Why market infrastructures face institutional scrutiny

Market infrastructures operate under a distinct constraint:

- Decisions are examined not only for correctness
- But for **institutional legitimacy**

When trading continues or halts, when data is published, when exceptions are applied, the question is often:

- *"Was the decision justifiable at the time?"*
- *"What was known, evaluated, and decided, and exactly when?"*

---

### Critical moments

This capability becomes relevant at points of no return such as:

- Trading halt / continuation decisions under uncertainty
- Market data publication under degraded conditions
- Methodology interpretation during exceptional events
- Exception handling / manual overrides in critical workflows
- Post-incident reviews where chronology itself becomes contested

---

### What "good" looks like under scrutiny

A defensible dossier contains:

- The exact execution(s) that occurred
- The evaluations that existed at the time
- Their order and timestamps
- The roles involved (without relying on memory)
- Integrity verifiable independently of source systems

---

### What changes

Before: cross-system reconstruction, interviews, narrative consolidation

After: **facts already exist**, immediately examinable
