# Evidence must exist before questions.

A factual evidence capability for regulated institutions, designed to **observe and preserve**, **at execution time**, what systems actually do and evaluate, whether decisions are automated or human.

These observations are produced as execution occurs, before any audit, incident, or investigation exists. When decisions are examined later, Horizon does not reconstruct events, infer intent, or assemble context retrospectively. It ensures that examination is performed on **pre-existing factual artefacts**, not on narratives rebuilt from logs, memory, or interpretation.

**Not a monitoring tool. Not a decision engine. Not a compliance shortcut.**
A neutral evidence layer that replaces reconstruction with fact

## Market Infrastructures

Exchanges, CCPs, CSDs, market data publishers.

## Systemic Banks

G-SIB/D-SIB contexts where decisions become institutionally examinable.

## The structural problem

Modern systems are designed to operate.

Very few are designed to be examined later.

When scrutiny begins, organizations fall back on logs, dashboards, tickets, and reconstruction. That works, until the question becomes: **"What exactly happened in this case?"**

---

## Principle

**Evidence is created at execution time, not when a question arises.**

### What this enables

- Stable, ordered, verifiable facts
- No post-hoc reconstruction required
- Examination without replaying systems or mobilizing multiple teams
