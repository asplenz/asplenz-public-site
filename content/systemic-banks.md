# Systemic Banks

## Systemic banks face a different kind of scrutiny

### Why systemic banks face institutional examination

In systemic contexts, what matters is not only whether controls existed, but whether the institution can prove:

- What it knew
- What it evaluated
- What it decided at time T

This is most visible when automated decisions interact with human escalation.

### High-criticality situations

Examples of "point of no return" situations:

- continuing critical services under partial outage
- overriding a blocking control under time pressure (fraud / sanctions / AML / risk)
- approving an exception with explicit risk acceptance
- operating under degraded or ambiguous market data
- model-assisted decisions where context changes (including GenAI/RAG-assisted workflows)

---

### What is typically missing today

- the human decision is recorded later (ticket notes, emails, post-mortems)
- the "state of knowledge" at the moment is reconstructed
- technical logs exist, but institutional stance is unclear

---

### What the capability provides

- execution facts + evaluation facts
- explicit linkage between automated triggers and human decisions
- ordered, immutable chronology
- verifiable integrity
