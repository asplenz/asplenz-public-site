# Engage

## Engage: an acceptability discussion (not a sales process)

### What we do

- We do not ask for internal incidents
- We do not present demos
- We do not promise ROI

---

### The single question

> **Would this evidence approach be defensible within your governance framework?**

---

### What this discussion produces

- **A shared understanding** of whether this approach is conceptually acceptable in your context
- **The main conditions** that would have to be met for such a capability to exist (governance, architecture, security boundaries)
- **The key objections or blockers**, if any, that would prevent adoption in your institution
- If relevant, **an outline of what a minimal, non-intrusive pilot could look like**, focused on a single point of no return defined as a specific moment where a decision or action becomes institutionally irreversible or materially consequential

---

### Schedule an acceptability discussion

A short, structured conversation focused on institutional defensibility. No demos. No incidents. No commercial discussion.
