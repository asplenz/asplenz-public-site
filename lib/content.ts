A discussion begins in Slack, continues via email, is clarified orally during a meeting, is settled over the phone, and then sometimes leaves an indirect trace in a Jira ticket or a ServiceNow form. The action itself is executed elsewhere still, in a terminal, a cloud console, or an automated system, while applications log what they can in files designed for diagnostics, not for proof. At the moment, this dispersion is not a problem. Teams understand each other, the decision flows, the organization moves forward.`,

We gather what remains: messages extracted from Slack, screenshots attached to emails, PDFs exported from business tools, tickets modified multiple times, technical logs that are difficult to interpret outside their original context. Very quickly, it becomes clear that this material is incomplete. Some discussions were never written down, some exchanges took place orally, some messages were deleted, some logs were purged, some people are no longer there. What is missing can no longer be recovered.`,

            title: 'Reconstruction replaces proof',
            content: `Faced with these absences, reconstruction inevitably becomes interpretive. Gaps are filled with memories, assumed intentions, and reasoning formulated after the fact. A coherent story takes shape, often in good faith, sometimes under pressure, but always influenced by the context in which the question is asked. This narrative may seem solid, but it no longer constitutes proof. The elements produced (screenshots, PDF exports, isolated emails) do not carry their own integrity. They do not allow an independent third party to verify that they have not been modified, selected, or taken out of context. They ask to be believed, and as soon as a piece of evidence asks to be believed, it ceases to be binding.`,

Memories alter, certainties shift. Six months later, or sometimes a year later, the decision only exists as a narrative the organization is capable of producing about itself. This narrative may be honest, precise, and detailed, but it remains vulnerable to doubt because it relies on a late reconstruction of a reality that was never captured.`,

Slack facilitates discussion, email structures communication, Jira organizes work, ServiceNow frames processes, technical systems execute, logs observe. But none of these tools is intended to freeze the moment a decision becomes irreversible, nor to attest that an authority declared something at a specific time. The decision traverses systems without ever being fully inscribed in them. It exists in action, but not as an autonomous, independently verifiable fact.`,

And explaining, as rigorously as possible, is never equivalent to proving. This is not a problem of discipline, nor of method, nor of goodwill. It is a structural problem. As long as it remains invisible, organizations will continue to believe they can explain later, only to discover, too late, that explaining is not proving.`,

But organization does not produce proof; it produces coherence. Workflows impose a path, but they do not guarantee that the actual decision was made within that path.

Its role is to capture the existence of a decisional fact at the precise moment it occurs, before any interpretation, before any reconstruction. As long as this category does not exist, every attempt at proof relies on secondary traces, which are fragile by nature.`,

            content: `A fact in Horizon is simply something declared by an identified actor, at a given moment. When a fact is declared (during a crisis, an exception, or normal operations), Horizon treats this declaration as a technical event to be sealed.\n\nThe sealing process follows a fixed sequence. First, the declaration is received from a technical channel (API, email, or system integration). Horizon does not inspect, validate, or interpret its content.\n\nHorizon then assigns a single authoritative timestamp, called sealed_at. This timestamp represents the moment the declaration was sealed by Horizon. It is the only time reference asserted by the system.\n\nThe declared content is stored as fully opaque data. Horizon does not impose a schema, enforce structure, or extract meaning from the payload.\n\nThe fact is then cryptographically hashed and signed. Its integrity becomes tamper-evident.\n\nFinally, the fact is appended to an immutable chain, linked to the previous fact within the same stream. This append-only construction ensures that facts cannot be altered or removed without detection.\n\nFacts are appended to a Facts Stream. A stream has no business state. It has no opening or closing. It does not represent a workflow, a decision lifecycle, or a process state.\n\nAt any point in time, additional facts may be declared and appended to the same stream. Horizon records that a relationship was declared and seals it, without interpreting its meaning.\n\nThroughout this process, Horizon does not decide what the fact means. It does not assess correctness, legitimacy, causality, or outcome. All interpretation remains external to Horizon.`,

Verification recomputes the chain and confirms that each fact correctly references the previous one and the final computed hash matches the bundle head_hash. This establishes append-only ordering and tamper evidence across the entire stream segment.\n\n**4.4 Bundle Consistency Verification**\nThe verifier checks that the bundle references the correct stream, the set of facts is complete up to head_hash, and no fact is missing, reordered, or duplicated.`,
